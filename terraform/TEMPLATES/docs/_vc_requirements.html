<ul>
    <li>A working ESXi infrastructure connected to ACI</li>
    <li>A port-group to carry the traffic between the K8s VMs and the ACI leaves. This must be manually created in vCenter. There is no requirement for vCenter to be integrated via a VMM domain</li>
    <li>A folder to store the K8s VMs, sub-folders are not supported at the moment</li>
    <li>A data store, shared if the VMs are required to run on more than one host</li>
    <li>Ubuntu VM template with the VMWare provisioning tool installed. 
      For simplicity a VM Template is provided with the VMWare provisioning tool installed as well as all the packages and container images.
      This speed up the installation process (from ~30min to 5min) and does not require your K8s cluster to have internet connectivity.
      This is great for labs/sandbox environments <br>
        I can upload a pre-made VM to vCenter for you as part of the installation process. <br>
        However if you prefer to upload the image manually you can:
          <ul>
            <li>download it from <a href="{{ url_for('static',filename='vm_templates/nkt_template.ova') }}">here</a></li>
            <li> Deploy it to vCenter</li>
            <li> Create a SnapShot, this is required as the hcl plan uses linked clones. </li>
            <li> Add a "Notes" to it called "nkt_template"</li>
          </ul> 
    </li>
 </ul>
