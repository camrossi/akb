NKT Supports also baremetal nodes, however the configurations steps are sligtly more complex.
When deploying on baremetal follow these steps
<ul>
    <li>The BM nodes must be pre-configured with:</li>
    <ul>
      <li> Host name: This will have to match the host name passed to NKT in teh Cluster definition page</li>
      <li> Physcal interfaces: needs to be pre-condifured in the Cluster Subnet and use the ACI Floating SVI as default gateway </li>
      <li> Physcal interfaces: Must use VLAN tagging, the rationale is that you could re-use the same physical interface also for in-band access/management</li>
      <li> IP address: This will have to match the IP address passed to NKT in the Cluster definition page</li>
      <li> (Optional) Interface boinding</li>
    </ul>
    <li>On ACI A VLAN must be allocated to carry the traffic generated by the nodes</li>
 </ul>

 Here a possible configuration for a baremetal node:
 <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap">
  network:
     ethernets:
         eth0:
             dhcp4: false
         eth1:
             dhcp4: false
     vlans:
       vlan311:
         id: 311
         link: bond0
         addresses: [192.168.18.1/24]
         gateway4: 192.168.18.254
         nameservers:
           search: [ cam.ciscolabs.com]
           addresses:
             - "10.67.185.100"
         dhcp4: false
     bonds:
        bond0:
            interfaces: [eth0, eth1]
            mtu: 1500
            parameters:
              mode: 802.3ad
     version: 2
